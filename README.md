- 👋 Hi, I’m @hatchedegg
- 👀 I’m interested in anything tiny, and get even more excited if it has a microcontroller / remote control / movement
- 💞️ At work I bridge the gap between mechanics, electronics and software. 
      By programming lightweight stuff myself I can better collaborate with software developers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (Circuit-)python. 
      My background is outside software. I stepped into microcontrollers when BasicSTAMPs were hot and moved to PLC structured text for work. 
      Now I am reintroducing myself to microcontroller boards. I have specific interest in BLE remote control and small motorized devices.
      Although this is mostly hobby related, I also use this for quick prototyping and mock-ups at work.
- 📫 How to reach me: If I like Github, I will add a way to contact me.
